In this project, i have taken out my time to include the signup and login pages.
There pages have been linked and data validation have been included in each text box. 
A database was created called "receipt" . N.B: The database must be created first before the code can be executed successfully.
An sql code was written and executed.
Download "XAMPP" and run the Apache and MySql.
The pages where also authenticated. Meaning the server was securely linked with the frontend pages and duly tested at time intervals.
The successful logging into an account takes the user to a landing page/ dashboard, which in turn contains only the reset button and the log out button.
This version of the app is still incomplete, based on the fact that the aim of the project is yet to be meant.
Version 2.0 would be released in 7 days time (11th January 2024.

Please you can test the code and give feedback where necessary to improve on the code, thereby helping to improve on the next version of the App.
